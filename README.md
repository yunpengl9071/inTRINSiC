# inTRINSiC

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common form of malignant brain tumor, represents a therapeutically intractable tumor type that currently lacks actionable strategies to classify tumors or identify tumor specific vulnerabilities. We provide a strategy to stratify glioblastomas which we designate integrative Modeling of Transcription Regulatory Interactions for Systematic inference of Susceptibility in Cancer (inTRINSiC). This strategy provides unprecedented resolution into tumor subtype-specific regulatory programs and facilitates the identification of specific genetic dependencies in individual patient tumors. inTRINSiC couples transcription factor regulatory analysis with protein-protein interaction data to try to identify key subtype-specific drug targets. Specifically, we are able to use the multilayer models to perform an in silico perturbation analysis and infer differential genetic vulnerabilities across GBM subtypes. For example, we have identified the MYB family member MYBL2 as a potential target specific for the Proneural subtype. Thus, these analyses can directly lead to therapeutically actionable strategies.

Here we provide the original code and scripts used for training our nonlinear regression models for gene expression regulation, cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, signature analyses and in silico perturbation experiments. Please feel free to contact Yunpeng Liu at yunpengl@mit.edu if you have any questions about the code!
